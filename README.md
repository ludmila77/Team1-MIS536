# COLORECTAL CANCER SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION
R code for SEER data analysis of COLORECTAL CANCER in different populations.

# Goal
Create a model to predict the probability of new cases to be a GRADE I-II or GRADE III-IV level. 

# Data source
https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collects and publishes cancer data through a coordinated system of strategically placed cancer registries which cover near 30% of the USA population. Currently there are 18 SEER registries in the USA.

# Importance:
Cancer is a public health issue. Investigating behavioral patterns that can influence cancer risk or cancer recurrence is important. Since there is no definitive cure for cancer, it becomes crucial to work towards early detection measures, treatments, and follow-up methods that are proven to save lives. 

# Availability:
The cancer data is available through the SEER website. SEER is an authoritative source for cancer statistics in the United States. 

# Documentation: 
SEER provides detailed documentation and glossary of statistical terms in the website. It has also made videos available to us that helps us navigate with the data in use.

# Support:
There is a “contact us” area on the website.  The website is supported by  Surveillance Research Program (SRP) in NCI's Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS)

# Size:
The 2000-2016 colon/rectal cancer dataset has 939,119 records, 35 columns and has a file size of 200 MB.
